                <p>
                    I am a graduate student at the University of Michigan pursuing a Master of Science in Information with a concentration in Agile Development.
                    I graduated from Nanjing University in China in 2022 with a major in Spanish Literature and a minor in Information Management. I
                    am passionate about creating people-first technology that is accessible, inclusive, and empathetic.

                <h2>Interest in the Public Field</h2>
                <p>
                    Since very young, I am interested in social poliy and public affairs. That's why I started my journey by doing internships in GPOs. 
                     I believe that technology is a potent storytelling device in the public affairs: data visualizations craft narratives,
                    websites host our stories, and creative programs like Photoshop bring our artistic visions to life. 
                    I aspire to tell stories through technology that amplify marginalized voices,
                    connect communities, and bridge gaps between people, technology, and information.
                </p>
                <h2>The Origin of My Interest</h2>
                <p>
                    </p>
                    Pallid daylight shone through the milky haze with the sharp smell of car emissions rising around and seizing my nose. That is part of my memory of my hometown, Jinan. Another part of it is the famous scenery of streams and springs in this Spring City. This absurd contradiction is due to an arbitrary policy: in excuse of protecting underground spring veins, the government of Jinan had prohibited the construction of subways. However, because of the lack of public transportation, the number of private vehicles shot up, leading to deteriorating air pollution. How could we foresee that a supposedly environment-protecting policy in turn destroyed the environment? It was then that I realized the significance of sustainable policy in guaranteeing civil life quality. That's why I started my journey to explore my potential in policy issues.
